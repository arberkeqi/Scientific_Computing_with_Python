# Scientific_Computing_with_Python

## Built-in Functions
### def (definition) -> doesn't run a code it remembers it and stores it there (store face) creates a bit of code and records it like a macro and it names whatever you choose -> we do this so we can't reuse the same lines and if there is a problem we can fix it easier
### break -> ends the current loop and jumps the statemnet immediatly following the loop
### continue -> ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop and starts the next iteartion

## Some Definitions
### parameter -> is a variable which is used in the function definition. It is a "handle" that allows the code in the function to access the argument for a particular function invocation.
### return -> often a function will take its arguments, do some computation, and return a value to be used as the value of the function call in the calling expression. 
### loops (repeated steps) -> have iteration variables that change each time through a loop. Often these iteration variables go through a sequance of numbers.
### Indefinite Loops -> "while" loops because they keep going until a logical condition becomes False
### Deinite Loops -> "for" loops because they execute an exact number of times
### is Operator -> can be used in logical expression, implies "is the same as", similar to but stronger than "=="
### is not -> also an operator
